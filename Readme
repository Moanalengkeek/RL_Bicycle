This is the code used for the AE4350 assignment.

There are two RL agents for riding a bicycle. To run the first, a SARSA(lamda) algorithm, you run AI_loop. The functions used for this agent are stored in dynamics.
To run the second, the folder bicycle (which contains the gymnasium environment) must first be installed locally. The muldules Gymnasium and Stable Baselines 3 are also used. This PPO algorithm is run in Train_AI_Gymnasium
